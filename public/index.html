  <h1>Return Osornio Park to the Community!</h1>

  <p>We, the undersigned citizens, request the following:</p>
  <ol>
	  <li>
      <strong>That the City of La Habra allow leashed dogs at Osornio Park</strong> when there are no active active and scheduled youth sports activities or other City-approved special events, as long as they are in compliance with other city rules about dogs</li>
    <li>
      <strong>That the City hold sports teams that use the park more accountable.</strong> This includes:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Making they follow the rules set out in their agreements</li>
        <li>Making sure they practice and play only during approved times</li>
        <li>Reminding them to please not leave trash after games, to not hang banners, to respect parking and other city rules just like other citizens, and to respect the citizens who visit and live near Osornio Park</li>
        <li>Reminding them not to approach people to tell them what they can or cannot do in a public park</li>
        <li>Making sure they don't have the ability to lock citizens out of Osornio Park in the future</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>That the City of La Habra take the community into account when making changes and improvements to Osornio park</strong></li>
