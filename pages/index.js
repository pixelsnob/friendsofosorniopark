        <h2>Where is Osornio Park?</h2>
        <p>
          Osornio Park is a public park about a half mile north of Whittier Blvd on Hacienda Road in
          La Habra, California <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Osornio+Park/@33.9455184,-117.9679094,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2d52420524789:0x953ec5839822663e!8m2!3d33.945514!4d-117.9657207" target="_blank">(Google Maps)</a>. The park
          used to be the playground and sports field for Hacienda School, until the school closed in 1989<sup><a href="#citation-1">[1]</a></sup>.

        <p>
          In 2001, the City of La Habra dedicated the park to Michael Osornio, who was killed by a drunk driver while on duty in 1994<sup><a href="#citation-2">[2]</a></sup>.
          The park remained basically untouched, and looked like the schoolyard that it once was until about 2010. It was enjoyed by residents,
          who would gather in the only open space in this area not already taken up by sports facilities, schools, or businesses.

        <p>
          In 2012, the City of La Habra decided to dedicate the park to the Pumas, a City-affiliated youth soccer team<sup><a href="#citation-3">[3]</a></sup>. The Pumas were awarded
          around $100,000 in state parks funds<sup><a href="#citation-4">[4]</a></sup>, which they used to convert Osornio Park into a soccer facility. Trees were removed, as well
          as a walking trail and exercise equipment that residents would use. Fences and locking gates were added, as well as "No Animals in Park"
          signs.

        <h2>Park Issues</h2>

        <ImageContainer src={require('../images/PSX_20191026_203307.jpg')} alt="Soccer team parents parking on the basketball courts at Osornio Park, La Habra, California"/>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Since 2011, people visiting the park with dogs have been approached by non-City officials threatening that the City of La Habra
            will cite them.</strong> People like the Puma's president, La Habra Heights firefighters, and Christian School employees, all approached
            local residents to tell them what to do in a public park -- even when the park 
            wasn't in use by sports teams, or anyone at all
          </li>
          <li>
            
            <strong>The park gets closed every winter for maintenance, and is sometimes completely locked so that the public can't access it, but sports teams
            continue to hold practices and games</strong>
           
          </li>
          <li>
            There are only two parking spots for the entire park, so <strong>sports team parents park on the basketball court, and have caused parking
            issues for the immediate neighbors</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            The <a href="http://www.lhcm.org/DocumentCenter/View/9212/City-of-La-Habra-Sport-Affiliate-Policy-PDF" target="_blank" title="Link to La Habra's Sports Affiliate Policy on their website">link to La Habra's "Sports Affiliate Policy"</a> is
            broken, so <strong>currently, there is no easy way to see what rules youth sports teams must abide by</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>For some reason, the signs that say "No Animals in Park" point to <a href="http://qcode.us/codes/lahabra/view.php?topic=6-6_04-6_04_150&frames=on" title="Link to La Habra Municipal Code 6.04.150">La Habra Municipal Code 6.04.150</a></strong>,
            which states <em>"Quarantine" means isolation of a dog or other animal in an enclosure or other environment so that the dog or animal cannot be subject to other animals
            or unauthorized persons. (Ord. 1627 ยง 1, 2003)</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            The latest <a href="https://www.lahabracity.com/DocumentCenter/View/7325/2018-sport-affiliate-park-use-calendars?bidId=" target="_blank" title="Link to La Habra's Sports Affiliate Facility Usage Calendar">Sports Affiliate Facility Usage Calendar</a> available
            is for 2018, so <strong>the public has no easy way to find out who has permission by the City to play at Osornio Park</strong>
