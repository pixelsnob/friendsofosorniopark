        <h2>About Osornio Park</h2>
        <p>
          Osornio Park is a public park about a half mile north of Whittier Blvd on Hacienda Road in
          La Habra, California <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Osornio+Park/@33.9455184,-117.9679094,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2d52420524789:0x953ec5839822663e!8m2!3d33.945514!4d-117.9657207" target="_blank">(Google Maps)</a>. The park
          used to be the playground and sports field for Hacienda School, until the school closed in 1989<FootnoteLink href="hacienda-school" name="Hacienda School footnote"/>.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2001, the City of La Habra dedicated the park to Michael Osornio, who was killed by a drunk driver while on duty in 1994<FootnoteLink href="la-times-article" name="Osornio Park Renaming, May 2, 2001 Los Angeles Times article footnote"/>.
          The park remained basically untouched, and looked like the schoolyard that it once was until about 2010. It was enjoyed by residents,
          who would gather in the only open space in this area not already taken up by sports facilities, schools, or businesses.
        </p>
        <FloatedImageContainer src="IMG_20191105_151138.jpg" caption="Memorial for Michael A. Osornio at Osornio Park"/>

        <p>
          In 2012, the City of La Habra decided to dedicate the park to the Pumas, a City-affiliated youth soccer team<FootnoteLink href="opening-ceremony" name="Osornio Park Pumas opening ceremony footnote"/>. The Pumas were awarded
          around $100,000 in state parks funds<FootnoteLink href="park-grants" name="California park grants foornote"/>, which they used to convert Osornio Park into a soccer facility. Trees were removed, as well
          as a walking trail and exercise equipment that residents would use. Fences and locking gates were added, as well as "No Animals in Park"
          signs.

        <h2>Park Issues</h2>
        <ul>
          {/* <li>
            <strong>Since 2011, people visiting the park with dogs have been approached by non-City officials threatening that the City of La Habra
            will cite them -- even when the park wasn't in use by anyone at all</strong>
          </li> */}
          <li>
            <strong>The park gets closed every winter for maintenance, and is sometimes completely locked so that the public can't access it, but sports teams
            continue to hold practices and games, even recently, and after residents have complained multiple times</strong>
            <FloatedImageContainer src={'IMG_20190128_133052.jpg'} caption='Osornio Park locked and closed to the public'/>
            
          </li>
          <li>
            There are only two parking spots for the entire park, so <strong>sports team parents park on the basketball court, and have caused parking
            issues for the immediate neighbors</strong>. The signs in the adjacent parking lot &mdash; which is actually in the City of La Habra Heights
            &mdash; <strong>clearly say that parking is for the preschool and school district next door, but sports teams park there anyway</strong>
            <FloatedImageContainer src="PSX_20191026_203307.jpg" caption="Sports team parents parking wherever they like, 2019"/>

          <li>
            Some neighbors are reporting that <strong>the portable lights that are brought in by the City for games and practices are sometimes left on
            until after 11 at night, and that they have had to go and turn them off themselves</strong>, even though the hours of operation for the park
            are "...Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m. to dusk, Saturday and Sundays 9:00 a.m. to dusk."
            <FootnoteLink href="sports-affiliate-policy-page-27" name="Sports affiliate policy, p. 27 footnote"/>

          <li>
            According to public records, <strong>one La Habra area soccer team has been applying for a permit to use the field at Osornio Park for several years
            and has been denied every year. These records appear to show that the City has little interest in issuing a permit to any other team besides the Pumas</strong>

            <strong>One of the members of the <a href="https://www.lahabracity.com/341/Community-Services-Commission" target="_blank">La Habra Community Services Commission</a> &mdash;
            the commission responsible for issuing field permits &mdash; is married
            to the Pumas Vice President</strong>. According to a document
            titled <a href="https://www.lahabracity.com/DocumentCenter/View/6192/The-Job-of-the-Community-Services-Commission?bidId=" target="_blank">The Job of the Community Services Commission</a>, "A
            Community Services Commissioner is an individual who can serve the long-range interests of the La Habra community, who is unbound by election promises, political expediency, or narrow
            interests", <strong className="alarming">but it's hard to see how someone this involved with the only soccer team allowed to play at Osornio Park can make objective and impartial decisions about Osornio Park</strong>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>For some reason, the signs that say "No Animals in Park" point to <a href="http://qcode.us/codes/lahabra/view.php?topic=6-6_04-6_04_150&frames=on" title="Link to La Habra Municipal Code 6.04.150" target="_blank">La Habra Municipal Code 6.04.150</a></strong>,
            which states "Quarantine means isolation of a dog or other animal in an enclosure or other environment so that the dog or animal cannot be subject to other animals

            During a meeting of the City Council on October 1, 2018,
            a resolution was passed allowing "certain City parks to be posted for access by dogs on leash". Osornio Park, as well as nearby La Bonita Park, were excluded,
            and the reason given was <strong>"due to active youth sports"</strong>, which is vague and does not specify <strong>why dogs on leashes
            are not allowed at the park when it is not in use by active youth sports<FootnoteLink href="city-council-minutes-page-4" name="October 1, 2018 La Habra City Council minutes, p. 4 footnote"/></strong>

            In the section titled "Purpose of Policy" of the {affiliatePolicyLink}, it states
            "we expect that each affiliate will always be respectful to the neighbors, staff, and community as a whole". It also lists values
            affiliates are expected to abide by, including "actively engaging and collaborating with local resources ensuring that we are
            contributing to the health of the community" and "promoting the communityโs interest as our highest priority". The Pumas, instead of
            working with the community, <strong>choose to take the forceful approach, using the power of city government to implement policies that
            promote their own interests, and ignoring the needs of the neighboring community:</strong>

              <li>

                own hands by approaching citizens to tell them that dogs were not allowed at Osornio Park and that the City would ticket them, even though residents have been taking their dogs here for

            <strong>There is confusion about what Osornio Park is to the public.</strong> Some petition signers thought that
            Osornio Park was a private space, and that it was owned by one person who rents the space out to other teams. To make matters worse,
            the City of La Habra and others like to refer to Osornio Park as a "sports park", but <strong>the term "sports park" has no special meaning</strong>, even
